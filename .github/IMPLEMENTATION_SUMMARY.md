# CI/CD Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the CI/CD implementation for the Terminplaner project.

## 📦 What Was Created

### GitHub Actions Workflows (4 files)

1. **`ci.yml`** - Continuous Integration
   - Runs on every push/PR to main branch
   - Builds API, runs all 42 tests, checks formatting
   - Ubuntu runner (fast and cost-effective)

2. **`deploy-api.yml`** - API Deployment
   - Manual trigger or tag-based (`v*.*.*`)
   - Builds for Linux x64 and Windows x64
   - Creates downloadable deployment packages

3. **`deploy-android.yml`** - Android App Deployment
   - Manual trigger or tag-based (`android-v*.*.*`)
   - Builds APK for Android installation
   - Includes commented template for signed builds

4. **`deploy-windows.yml`** - Windows App Deployment
   - Manual trigger or tag-based (`windows-v*.*.*`)
   - Builds Windows desktop app
   - Includes commented template for signed builds

### Documentation (3 files)

1. **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Comprehensive deployment guide (11KB)
   - How to use each workflow
   - Installation instructions for API (Linux/Windows)
   - Android and Windows app distribution
   - Update strategies for future releases
   - Security considerations

2. **`.github/WORKFLOWS.md`** - Quick reference guide (8.7KB)
   - Workflow comparison table
   - Common use cases
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Configuration details

3. **Updated `README.md`**
   - Added deployment section
   - Links to detailed guides

## ✨ Key Features

### For Local/Personal Use
- ✅ Simple manual deployment via GitHub Actions UI
- ✅ No complex setup required
- ✅ Download artifacts directly from workflow runs
- ✅ Clear instructions for each platform

### For Future Production Use
- ✅ Commented templates for signed builds (Android keystore, Windows certificate)
- ✅ Tag-based automatic deployment
- ✅ Multiple platform support
- ✅ Environment selection (production/staging/development)

### CI/CD Best Practices
- ✅ Automated testing on every commit
- ✅ Separate workflows for different platforms
- ✅ Artifact retention (30-90 days)
- ✅ Manual approval via workflow_dispatch
- ✅ Clear naming and documentation

## 🎯 Design Decisions

### Why These Workflows?

**CI Workflow (ci.yml):**
- Essential for code quality
- Runs on every push/PR to catch issues early
- Ubuntu runner = fastest and cheapest
- No artifacts = minimal storage usage

**Deploy API (deploy-api.yml):**
- Local deployment focus (family/personal use)
- Builds for common platforms (Linux, Windows)
- Creates ready-to-extract packages
- Can be extended to automated deployment later

**Deploy Android (deploy-android.yml):**
- Windows runner = best MAUI support
- Unsigned APK for testing/family use
- Signed build template for Play Store (future)
- Manual trigger = full control

**Deploy Windows (deploy-windows.yml):**
- Similar to Android but for Windows
- Can produce MSIX for Microsoft Store
- Flexible configuration options

### Update Strategy Recommendations

**Current (Personal Use):**
1. User checks GitHub Releases
2. Downloads new APK/installer
3. Installs over existing version
4. Simple and effective for family use

**Future Options:**
1. **In-app notifications** - Check API for new versions
2. **GitHub Releases integration** - Automatic release creation
3. **Auto-updates** - Play Store/Microsoft Store
4. **Staged rollouts** - Test with subset of users first

See DEPLOYMENT.md for detailed implementation guidance.

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Secrets Not Required (Current Setup)
- All builds are unsigned (debug/testing)
- Suitable for personal/family use
- No sensitive data exposed

### When Needed (Production)
Configure these GitHub Secrets:

**Android:**
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`

**Windows:**
- `WINDOWS_PFX_BASE64`
- `WINDOWS_PFX_PASSWORD`

### API Security
For production deployment, add:
- HTTPS enforcement
- Authentication (JWT/API keys)
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Environment-specific configs

## 📊 Validation & Testing

### YAML Validation
All workflows validated with `yamllint`:
- ✅ Valid YAML syntax
- ⚠️ Minor style warnings (line length) - cosmetic only
- ✅ Correct GitHub Actions syntax

### Build Testing
API publish command tested locally:
```bash
✅ dotnet publish for linux-x64 succeeded
✅ Executable created correctly (ELF 64-bit)
✅ All dependencies included
✅ Configuration files present
```

### Test Suite
All existing tests pass:
```
✅ 42 tests total
✅ 23 unit tests (AppointmentService)
✅ 19 integration tests (API endpoints)
✅ 100% success rate
```

## 📈 Usage Instructions

### For Users (Sister's Use Case)

1. **Download the app once:**
   - Go to GitHub Actions
   - Select "Deploy Android App"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Wait for completion
   - Download APK artifact
   - Install on Android device

2. **When updates are available:**
   - Repeat the process
   - Install new APK (data preserved)

### For Developers

1. **Push code:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   CI runs automatically ✅

2. **Create release:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
   API deployment runs automatically ✅

3. **Build Android:**
   - GitHub → Actions → Deploy Android App → Run workflow

4. **Build Windows:**
   - GitHub → Actions → Deploy Windows App → Run workflow
